This is a CLI ARFF Converter built for CSCI447 - Soft Computing.
Built by Tiana Smith, Elias Athey, and Aaron McCarthy

This converter takes in a data file (.dat, .data, .csv, or .txt) and converts it into an ARFF file that [WEKA](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) can use.

We are building this so we can test some of WEKA's Machine Learning algorithms on datasets from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

## The 5 Datasets
- [Iris Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)
- [Lenses Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Lenses)
- [Vertebral Column Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Vertebral+Column)
- [Abalone Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)
- [Haberman's Survival](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Haberman%27s+Survival)
